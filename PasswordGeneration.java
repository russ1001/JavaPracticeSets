 * Russell Streff

 * Problem Set #5
 * 
 *  
 * Problem Statement #3 â€“ Password Generation* 
 *
Take, as input, an integer n that is greater than 0 and randomly generate a password of length n.  
If the value entered is 0 or less then display an error.   
The password may contain characters between ! and ~.  
Please refer to the ASCII table for additional information. 

Input Format 
An integer to denote the size of the password to be generated.  Must be greater than 0. 

Output Format 
An n length string containing randomly generated characters.

*Keep in mind that if you use Math.random() to generate the password then you may not end up with a secure password.
*Secure passwords eliminate repetition and contain high entropy.  
*Math.random() is predictable when given the first value.
